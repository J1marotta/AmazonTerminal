Processes taken :
 To start with we did Trello user stories : https://trello.com/b/uZtbUrI0
 and we established our mvp would have to include 4 features

 1: print a list of all books available
 2: A cart feature
 3: A recommendation by author
 4: A recommendation by genre.

 We then brainstormed flow of the user experience on paper and How we wanted the
 program to react.

We then established our classes/ methods and attributes. As the main goal was to
work with classes, we focused on that first. This was excellent practice and utilising

ObjectSpace object definition was a really essential tool we used for working with
all our objects at once.


Overall this was a challenging project as we got stuck trying to compare objects and classes to variables
